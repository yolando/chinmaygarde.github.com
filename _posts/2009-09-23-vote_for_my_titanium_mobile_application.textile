title: Vote For My Titanium Mobile Application
postdate: 23 September, 2009

My application "You Are Here", built using the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile framework has been selected as one of the three finalists of the Titanium Mobile Developer Contest.

The application uses the Geolocation API's of the iPhone and Android platforms to post updates to the Brightkite network and search for Tweets by location. You can view a "screencast":http://www.vimeo.com/6184856 of the application in action on both the iPhone and Android platforms <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and "vote":http://www.appcelerant.com/titanium-mobile-developer-contest-finalists.html for it.</span>

*Update:* I won the "second prize":http://www.appcelerant.com/titanium-mobile-developer-contest-results.html in the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Developer contest. Thanks to everyone who voted for me. You guys are awesome!

*Update 2:* The app is now live on the App Store. Get it "here":http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=329502169&amp;mt=8.

*Buzzy*
